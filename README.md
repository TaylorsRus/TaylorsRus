## Joshua Taylor, Experienced Roblox Developer
I'm an 19-year-old programmer from the United Kingdom. While primarily a game developer, I have a deep passion for online creation. I enjoy content creation and sharing my knowledge within the communities I interact with.
Knowledge is power.

## Libs/Utils I want to make, all focused on minimality,
- Signal implementation, global signals table for global access to locally defined signals, akin to Bindables
- Collection of lune scripts for fast-tracking workflows and spending less time on quick fixes for trivial problems
- A base component library of generic components which are intended to be imported and then modified from there on out, *not* used like a package.
  - Will aim to dispoe of verbose or redundant props, ex; Combining 'AnchorPoint' and 'Position' into the string literal 'Alignment'
- A collision module with a sleek api for covering most usecases of collision, not intended to be efficient, intended to be easy
- An OOP, imperative spring module, most solutions are declaritive and embedded in UI libs, not ideal for animating physical things
